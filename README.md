### About lvl^
lvl^ is a gamified education enrichment platform for students currently enrolled in a Galvanize immersive learning programs.  lvl^ is a full-stack web application that gives students and administrators an interface to participate in a reward based platform designed to help students reach their career goals.  Students are provided with challenges and rewards which fall into four categories: education, community, career and life.  These challenges give students an opportunity to complete tasks that will contribute to their growth in the respective categories. Examples of challenges include: mentoring a student in a junior cohort, conducting informational interviews, building a side project, or writing a LinkedIn/Medium article. Students earn points for completing challenges which can be cashed in for rewards. Rewards can include 30 minutes of paired programming with an instructor, a ticket to a Galvanize community lunch, business cards, or a $5 gift card to the cafe.

### To Get Started
1. Please fork and clone this repo.
2. `cd lvlup-frontend` Change directories into the front end folder
3. `npm install` Install dependencies
4. `npm run build` Run a production build of our app
5. `mv build ../lvlup-backend` Move the Build Folder to the root of the /lvlup-backend directory.
6. `cd ../lvlup-backend` Change directories into the back end folder
7. `npm install` Install dependencies
8. `touch .env` Example .env file:
```
JWT_KEY= xxxxxx
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= xxxxxx
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= xxxxxx
SESSION_KEY1= xxxxxxx
SESSION_KEY2=xxxxx
```
9. Please note this repo requires GitHub OAuth. Please go to the [GitHub Developer Console](https://github.com/settings/developers) and under 'OAuth Applications' register a new application and update the .env file with the client id and secret. The callback URL will need to be updated here on line 61 in lvlup-backend/app.js:

```JavaScript
passport.use(new GitHubStrategy({
  clientID: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackURL: 'http://yourURL/api/auth/github/callback',
  //localhost:3000 is default port if running locally
},
  (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
    // process.nextTick(() => done(null, profile));
    done(null, profile);
  }));
```
10. Create the database locally. From the command line run the following commands:
`
createdb lvlup_dev  //For running development environment locally
createdb lvlup_test  //To run all of the tests
`

11. Seed the database. From the command line run the following commands:
`
knex migrate:rollback //Only if dropping the database and reseeding
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run
`
12. `npm start` To run locally
13. lvl^ !
